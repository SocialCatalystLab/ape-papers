**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Review

Following revision based on Round 1 feedback, the paper has addressed the main concerns:

1. **Table environments:** Fixed. Tables now render correctly without double-wrapping.
2. **Age label consistency:** All tables and figures now correctly reference "All Ages, Age-Adjusted" rather than "Ages 25-64".
3. **State count consistency:** Paper consistently reports 17 treated states throughout.
4. **Treatment reclassification:** Clearly explained in Section 2.3 and Section 4.

### Remaining Minor Issues

- The COVID death rate coefficient in Table 3 still displays as 0.000**, which is technically accurate but may confuse readers. A footnote explaining the scale would help, but this is cosmetic.
- No MDE calculation, but the qualitative discussion of power limitations is thorough.

### Assessment

The paper is methodologically sound, honestly presents a null result, and provides extensive robustness checks. The writing is clear and flows well. The contribution—establishing a well-powered null on the mortality effects of copay caps—is genuine and relevant.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
