# Section-by-Section Review

## The Opening
**Verdict:** [Hooks immediately]
The opening is excellent. You avoid the "economic throat-clearing" trap and lead with a human cost that the reader can visualize.
*   **The Hook:** "In 2020, more than 190,000 women lost Medicaid coverage within 60 days of giving birth..." This is a Shleifer-style concrete observation. It grounds the paper in a real-world problem before the math starts.
*   **The Transition:** The move from the "coverage cliff" (the demand side) to the "less visible question" of provider supply is a textbook pivot.
*   **Clarity:** By the end of the second paragraph, I know exactly what the paper is about: the supply-side response to Medicaid extensions.

## Introduction
**Verdict:** [Shleifer-ready]
This is a very strong, professional introduction. It follows the essential arc: motivation, the "unfunded mandate" problem, the data innovation (T-MSIS), and the core findings.
*   **The "What we find":** You are specific. You note the 33% increase in claims and the 12% increase in providers. 
*   **The Human Stake (Glaeser/Katz influence):** "Eligible women hold insurance cards that buy access to empty waiting rooms." This is a fantastic sentence. It makes the abstract concept of "provider supply" visceral.
*   **One suggestion:** The "roadmap" paragraph on page 4 is standard but could be more Shleifer-esque by being shorter or integrated. However, it doesn't hurt the flow much.

## Background / Institutional Context
**Verdict:** [Vivid and necessary]
You manage to make the American Rescue Plan and the Public Health Emergency (PHE) feel like active participants in a story rather than a list of statutes.
*   **The "Coverage Cliff":** Using the term "cliff" keeps the momentum going.
*   **The PHE Section:** This is a complex institutional detail, but you explain the "bindingness" logic perfectly. The reader needs to understand the PHE to believe your identification; you explain it just in time.

## Data
**Verdict:** [Reads as narrative]
You successfully weave the data description into the story of measurement.
*   **The Story of T-MSIS:** You present the T-MSIS file not just as a source, but as a "novel dataset" that finally allows for Medicare-level granularity in Medicaid. This justifies the paper's existence.
*   **The Linkage:** The NPPES linkage section is clear and defensive in the right way (addressing the cross-state billing concern in a footnote).

## Empirical Strategy
**Verdict:** [Clear to non-specialists]
The logic precedes the equations. 
*   **Intuition first:** "We compare outcomes in adopting states to not-yet-treated states." 
*   **Technical Balance:** You cite Callaway & Sant’Anna and Goodman-Bacon to satisfy the experts, but the prose remains accessible to the "busy economist."

## Results
**Verdict:** [Tells a story]
You follow the "Katz" rule: you tell the reader what they learned before you point to the table.
*   **Good Prose:** "The extension increased log postpartum claims by 0.2834... corresponding to approximately a 33% increase."
*   **Mechanisms:** The discussion of LARC (long-acting reversible contraception) as the "paradigmatic example" of a service that fits the 12-month window is excellent. It gives the result a clinical logic.
*   **The "Honest" Result:** You are upfront about the "marginally significant" provider entry effect. Shleifer's prose is often characterized by this kind of cool-headed honesty.

## Discussion / Conclusion
**Verdict:** [Resonates]
The "Coverage-vs-Rates Tradeoff" section (7.2) is the heart of the paper’s contribution to economic thought. 
*   **The Final Punch:** The closing sentence is strong: "It suggests that the 60-day postpartum limit was not just a coverage gap for patients, but a participation barrier for providers." This reframes the entire policy debate.

## Overall Writing Assessment

- **Current level:** [Top-journal ready]
- **Greatest strength:** The pivot from the human "coverage cliff" to the economic "participation barrier." You make a technical paper about billing codes feel like a paper about women's health.
- **Greatest weakness:** The transition into the Robustness/Appendix results in the text can occasionally feel like a checklist (e.g., page 19).
- **Shleifer test:** Yes. A smart non-economist would be hooked by page 1 and understand the stakes by page 2.

### Top 5 Concrete Improvements:

1.  **Eliminate "It is important to note":** On page 5, you have "Importantly, the adoption decision was made..." Just say: "The adoption decision was made at the state level..." Shleifer cuts these meta-comments.
2.  **Sharpen Section 6.2:** You write "Table 2 presents the aggregate treatment effects." This is a "Column 3" sentence. **Rewrite to:** "The primary results, reported in Table 2, show that the extension stimulated both the volume of care and the number of participating providers."
3.  **Vary Sentence Length in the Conclusion:** The first paragraph of the conclusion is three sentences of almost identical length. **Try:** "Forty-seven states have extended Medicaid postpartum coverage. They did so to fix a 'coverage cliff' that harms mothers. This paper asks if providers responded." (Short, punchy).
4.  **The "Roadmap" Sentence:** On page 4, you say "Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 details the empirical strategy." Since your headers are clear, you can replace this with a single sentence: "The following sections describe our use of T-MSIS claims data and a staggered difference-in-differences design to estimate these effects."
5.  **Active Voice in Mechanism:** On page 18, "The extension enables coverage for these services..." is good. But "The event study shows a noisy but generally positive path..." could be "The event study reveals a positive, if noisy, path." Small shifts to active verbs like *reveals*, *confirms*, or *highlights* keep the Glaeser-style energy up.

**Final Thought:** This is exceptionally clean prose. It lacks the "clutter" of many working papers. Maintain this discipline through the final draft.
