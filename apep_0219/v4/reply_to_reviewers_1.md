## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast (Minor Revision)

**Concern 1:** Table formatting issues — Table 3 rightmost column truncated.

**Response:** Fixed. Applied `\small` font size and `@{}` column padding to Table 3 (Main RDD Results). The full 95% CI `[-0.73, 0.93]` is now fully visible. Applied the same treatment to Table 6 (Year-by-Year) in the appendix.

**Concern 2:** Introduction structure should match AER conventions.

**Response:** Removed the `\subsection*{Contribution and Related Literature}` header from the Introduction. The contribution and literature discussion now flows as continuous prose without internal subsection breaks, matching AER style. Additionally, rewrote the mechanical "This paper makes four contributions. First, ... Second, ... Third, ... Fourth, ..." enumeration as flowing narrative prose.

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash (Minor Revision)

**Concern 1:** Spatial spillovers not discussed.

**Response:** Added a new paragraph in Section 4.3 (Threats to Validity) explicitly addressing spatial SUTVA concerns. The discussion acknowledges that if ARC-funded infrastructure in Distressed counties serves residents of neighboring At-Risk counties, the RDD estimate is biased toward zero. Notes that geographic clustering of Distressed counties in Central Appalachia makes cross-boundary spillovers plausible.

**Concern 2:** Map buried in appendix.

**Response:** Promoted the Appalachian counties map from Appendix D to Section 2 (Institutional Background), where it now appears as Figure 1. This matches the convention in place-based policy papers of presenting the geographic setting early.

3. **Prose polish:** Deleted roadmap filler, tightened data section opening, simplified word choices in threats to validity section.
