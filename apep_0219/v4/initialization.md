## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-6

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0219
**Parent Title:** The Distress Label Trap: Place-Based Aid and Economic Stagnation in Appalachia
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION (2/3 reviewers), MAJOR REVISION (1/3)
**Revision Rationale:** User-directed improvements to title, contribution framing, literature integration, and LaTeX compilation; reviewer-requested first-stage proxy

## Key Changes Planned

- New title (replace "Distress Label Trap")
- Literature review woven into introduction (AER style)
- Strengthened contribution framing
- LaTeX compilation fixes
- First-stage proxy via USAspending.gov (if data available)
- Additional references per reviewer requests

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT-5-mini (Major Revision):** First-stage grant data → attempting USAspending proxy; panel RD specs → acknowledged; wild bootstrap → acknowledged
2. **Grok-4.1-Fast (Minor Revision):** Missing references (Lee & Lemieux) → adding; coal dependence heterogeneity → addressed in v2
3. **Gemini-3-Flash (Minor Revision):** First-stage proxy → attempting; spatial spillovers → acknowledged; long-run outcomes → flagged

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Effect of ARC Distressed designation on county economic outcomes
- Identification strategy: Sharp RDD at CIV threshold
- Primary data source: ARC CIV data + BLS/Census/BEA outcomes
