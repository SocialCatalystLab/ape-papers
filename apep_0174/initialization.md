## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0172
**Parent Title:** Shining Light on Nothing? Null Effects of Salary Transparency Laws on New Hire Wages
**Parent Decision:** CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT / MINOR REVISION / MAJOR REVISION (mixed panel)
**Revision Rationale:** User feedback: broaden literature engagement, add powerful hook, streamline, polish, abstract under 150 words

## Key Changes Planned

1. Rewrite abstract to under 150 words
2. Add powerful hook in introduction - connect to broader economics questions
3. Broaden literature engagement beyond single Cullen & Pakzad-Hurson paper
4. Streamline paper by consolidating redundant sections (border analysis repeated 3x → 1x)
5. Polish prose throughout

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT-5-mini:** Clustering inference with few states → acknowledged limitation
2. **Gemini-3-Flash:** Add monopsony literature engagement → ADDING
3. **Grok-4.1-Fast:** Remove AI footnote, tighten border repetition → DOING

## User-Requested Changes (Primary Focus)

1. **Narrow literature** → Broaden to fundamental economics (information, bargaining, search)
2. **Weak hook** → Powerful opening that captures attention
3. **Long abstract** → Under 150 words
4. **Repetitive** → Streamline and polish

## Inherited from Parent
