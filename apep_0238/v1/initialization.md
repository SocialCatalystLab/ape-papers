## User Responses

1. Surprise me (Recommended) — full macro-labor frontier
2. Surprise me → Random draw: LP-IV (Local Projections with Instrumental Variables)
3. Modern (implied by macro labor JMP context)
4. Yes — all API keys configured
5. Yes (Recommended) — tri-model hybrid reviews
6. Novel angle (user wants JMP-quality macro paper bridging applied micro)
7. "I need a job market paper. We need a model, usually JMPs do. 40+ pages of beautifully written prose, maps, figures, tables. Extensive appendix, 10+ pages. Python or R, whatever works. I don't care what software you use, just that the code is replicable."

## Setup Results

- **Domain:** Macro labor (open exploration)
- **Method:** LP-IV (Local Projections with Instrumental Variables) (random)
- **Data era:** Modern
- **Risk appetite:** Novel angle — classic macro question with modern micro identification
- **Other preferences:** Structural model required, 40+ pages main text, maps, extensive appendix (10+ pages), language-agnostic (Python chosen for structural model compatibility)
