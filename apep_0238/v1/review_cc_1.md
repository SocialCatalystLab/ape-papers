## Summary

This paper compares the scarring effects of the Great Recession (demand shock) and COVID recession (supply shock) using cross-state LP-IV regressions and a calibrated DMP model. The central finding — that demand recessions generate persistent employment scars while supply recessions do not — is empirically well-supported and theoretically motivated.

## Strengths

1. **Novel contribution**: First direct empirical comparison of demand vs supply recession dynamics in the same labor markets, using the same identification framework.
2. **Clean identification**: Housing price boom (GR) and Bartik shift-share (COVID) are well-established instruments with strong theoretical backing.
3. **Structural model**: DMP with endogenous participation and skill depreciation provides microfoundations for the reduced-form patterns and enables counterfactual analysis.
4. **Extensive robustness**: Permutation tests, census division clustering, leave-one-out, alternative Bartik base years, Sand State exclusion.
5. **Writing quality**: Clear narrative arc, accessible to non-specialists, concrete magnitudes throughout.
6. **Visual quality**: 11 figures including state tile maps, IRF comparisons, model-data overlays, JOLTS decomposition.

## Areas Addressed in Revision

1. Clarified reduced-form vs IV estimation (new paragraph in Section 5.1)
2. Strengthened inference discussion (expanded Section 5.4)
3. Added Guerrieri et al. Keynesian supply shock discussion (Section 3.7)
4. Added missing citations (Cerra & Saxena, Cameron et al., Dingel & Neiman, Mongey et al.)
5. Expanded limitations with mediation analysis and migration control directions
6. Added teleworkability discussion for COVID instrument

## Remaining Limitations (Acknowledged)

- Small cross-sectional N (46-48) — addressed via permutation tests
- Sample of two recessions — discussed in Conclusion
- State-level ecological inference — individual CPS analysis noted as future work
- Policy endogeneity — argued to reinforce rather than undermine the thesis

## Assessment

The paper meets all publication requirements: 58 pages, all 4 advisors PASS, 3 external reviews complete, comprehensive robustness checks. Ready for publication.
