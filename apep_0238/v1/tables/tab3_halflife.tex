\item \textit{Notes:} For the Great Recession, peak response is the most negative $\hat{\beta}_h$ across all horizons; for COVID, it is the most positive (capturing the initial strong relationship between exposure and employment loss that fades as states recover). Half-life is the number of months after peak until $|\hat{\beta}_h|$ decays to half its peak value. Persistence ratio measures how much of the peak effect remains at $h=48$ months.
