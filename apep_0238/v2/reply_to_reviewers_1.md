## Referee 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

### Concern 1: Reduced-form vs IV language clarity
**Response:** We have ensured consistent language throughout. Section 5.1 now contains an explicit paragraph ("Estimation approach") clarifying that all estimates are reduced-form local projections, not 2SLS/IV. The term "instrument" is used in the reduced-form tradition of Mian & Sufi (2014) and Autor et al. (2013), meaning an exogenous source of cross-state variation in exposure. No first-stage F-statistics are reported because no 2SLS is estimated; instead, the cross-sectional R² values (0.10–0.12 at short horizons) demonstrate the strength of the exposure–outcome relationship.

### Concern 2: Permutation test documentation
**Response:** We have added a formal algorithm description in the appendix (Section 9.5) documenting the 4-step procedure: (1) estimate baseline β_h, (2) randomly reassign Z_s across states 1,000 times without replacement, holding X_s and outcomes fixed, (3) re-estimate β_h^(b) for each permutation, (4) compute two-sided p-value. Permutation p-values are reported in the text for key horizons.

### Concern 3: Exposure-robust SEs for Bartik
**Response:** Adao et al. (2019) exposure-robust SEs are implemented and reported in the appendix robustness tables. The main tables report HC1 SEs for simplicity; the appendix demonstrates that significance is preserved under the Adao et al. correction.

### Concern 4: Migration controls
**Response:** We have substantially expanded the migration discussion in Section 5.5 (Threats to Validity). We now cite Dao (2017) on the secular decline in interstate migration responsiveness, arguing that migration is unlikely to explain the persistent scarring pattern. The fact that Great Recession scarring persists at 84 months despite any migration adjustment underscores the severity of the demand-shock mechanism.

### Concern 5: Missing methodological citations
**Response:** Added Goodman-Bacon (2021) and Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021) to the bibliography. Added a new paragraph in Section 5.1 explaining why LP is preferred over TWFE/staggered DiD: the exposure is continuous (housing boom magnitude, Bartik shock intensity), not discrete treatment adoption, and LP directly estimates horizon-specific responses without parametric assumptions.

### Concern 6: Worker-level mediation analysis
**Response:** We acknowledge this as a valuable direction for future work. The current paper operates at the state level by design—the identification strategy exploits cross-state variation in recession exposure. Worker-level analysis using CPS/LEHD would complement but not substitute for the state-level evidence, and we note this in the conclusion.

### Concern 7: Policy controls (PPP, CARES Act)
**Response:** Section 7.4 discusses fiscal policy qualitatively. We note that the different policy responses are not confounders but rather consequences of the different shock types—rapid fiscal intervention was effective for COVID precisely because the underlying shock was transient. Quantifying policy intensity at the state level is a valuable extension but requires data on PPP loan allocation and state UI generosity at monthly frequency, which we leave to future work.

### Concern 8: CE welfare contextualization
**Response:** We have added a sentence explicitly contextualizing the 33.5% CE loss, explaining that it corresponds to the representative worker permanently forgoing one-third of their consumption stream, and that the magnitude reflects the permanent productivity decline generated by the scarring channel.

## Referee 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): MINOR REVISION

### Concern 1: Add 3 missing references
**Response:** Added Goodman-Bacon (2021) and Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021). The Dupraz et al. (2022) plucking model was already cited in the introduction. GPS (2020), Borusyak et al. (2022), and Adao et al. (2019) were already cited throughout.

### Concern 2: Report F-statistics
**Response:** As the paper uses reduced-form LP (not 2SLS), F-statistics are not applicable. The cross-sectional R² values serve as the analogous measure of instrument relevance and are reported in all main tables.

### Concern 3: Migration controls
**Response:** See response to Referee 1, Concern 4. Expanded migration discussion with Dao (2017) citation.

### Concern 4: Minor prose trim
**Response:** Removed roadmap paragraph from the introduction. Tightened several passages in the results and mechanisms sections.

## Referee 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): MINOR REVISION

### Concern 1: Migration vs. scarring decomposition
**Response:** See response to Referee 1, Concern 4. We have strengthened the discussion and noted that declining interstate migration (Dao 2017) makes this channel less likely to explain the results.

### Concern 2: Plucking model literature
**Response:** Dupraz, Nakamura & Steinsson (2022) is already cited in the introduction and conceptual framework, providing the "asymmetry" of shocks context that the reviewer requests.

### Concern 3: Fiscal policy interaction
**Response:** See response to Referee 1, Concern 7. The fiscal policy discussion in Section 7.4 addresses this qualitatively. Cross-state PPP regressions are a natural extension but require additional data work beyond the current scope.
