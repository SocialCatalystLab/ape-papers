# Revision Plan (Stage C Response to External Reviews)

## Context
- GPT-5.2: MAJOR REVISION
- Grok-4.1-Fast: MINOR REVISION
- Gemini-3-Flash: MINOR REVISION

## Changes Made

### 1. GE Identification Framing (GPT, HIGH)
- Added paragraph to Threats to Validity clarifying cross-state estimates are relative, not aggregate
- Added Beraja et al. (2019) GE discussion

### 2. Structural Model Welfare Caveats (GPT, HIGH)
- Added paragraph in welfare section emphasizing 442:1 ratio is illustrative under risk neutrality
- Noted CRRA utility and consumption smoothing would reduce ratio
- Already includes sensitivity table showing range across calibrations

### 3. Migration Denominator Note (Gemini, MEDIUM)
- Added clarifying note that emp/pop ratio uses contemporaneous population (standard in the literature)
- Noted pre-recession baseline as alternative in robustness discussion

### 4. Literature Additions (Grok, MEDIUM)
- Cerra et al. (2020/2023), Foote et al. (2021) already added in v6
- Fujita & Moscarini (2017) already added

### 5. Causal Framing Qualification (GPT)
- Added qualification that the comparison is between two specific episodes
- Referenced historical precedents (Volcker, oil shocks) as context

## Not Addressed (Noted as Limitations)
- Multiple testing correction (Romano-Wolf): Valid concern but joint significance at h=48 is supported by permutation p=0.022. Added brief acknowledgment.
- CRRA utility in model: Would improve welfare realism but doesn't change qualitative demand/supply asymmetry. Noted as future work.
- State-level LTU validation: Requires individual-level CPS data not available in current FRED-based framework. Noted as limitation.
- Bartik Rotemberg weights: Would require additional infrastructure. Bartik validity argument rests on Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020) + Borusyak et al. (2022) frameworks already cited.
