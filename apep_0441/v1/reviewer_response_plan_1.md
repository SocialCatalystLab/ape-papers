# Reviewer Response Plan

## Summary of Feedback

All three referees (GPT: Major, Grok: Major, Gemini: Minor) praise the paper's transparency about identification challenges and writing quality. Common themes:

### Grouped Concerns

1. **Pre-trends / ID** (All 3): Pre-trends violation is fundamental. Need Rambachan-Roth bounds or alternative ID.
2. **Missing references** (GPT, Grok): Need Roth 2022, Conley-Taber 2011, Goodman-Bacon 2021, Freyaldenhoven et al. 2019.
3. **Table 2 CS-DiD layout** (GPT, Exhibit): CS-DiD ATT should be on its own clearly-labeled row.
4. **Mechanisms evidence** (GPT, Gemini): Administrative proximity claims are speculative.
5. **Prose polish** (Prose review): Kill table narration, tighten transitions.

### Revision Priorities

1. **Add Rambachan-Roth sensitivity bounds** — most impactful ID improvement
2. **Add missing references** — 5-6 key citations
3. **Prose improvements** — address top 3 from prose review
4. **Minor table fixes** — clarify CS-DiD row in Table 2

### What Won't Change
- Core design (DiD with honest pre-trends discussion)
- Paper length and structure
- Main results and heterogeneity analysis
