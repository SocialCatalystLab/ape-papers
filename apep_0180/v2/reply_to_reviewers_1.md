We thank all three reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on the original manuscript. The revision addresses each major concern. Below we respond to the key issues raised.

## Response to Common Concerns

### 1. Prose vs. Bullets (All Reviewers)

**Concern:** Multiple sections used bullet lists where flowing paragraphs are expected for a top journal, giving the paper a "technical report" feel.

**Response:** We have converted ALL bullet lists in the main text to flowing prose paragraphs. Specifically:

- Section 2.2 (Haushofer findings): Four bullets → two substantive paragraphs synthesizing consumption, asset, earnings, and psychological effects
- Section 2.3 (Egger design): Three bullets → cohesive paragraph explaining cluster randomization
- Section 2.3 (Egger findings): Five bullets → two paragraphs on recipient effects and GE spillovers
- Section 2.4 (Government relevance): Four bullets → analytical paragraph on generalizability
- Section 3.2 (Fiscal externalities): Enumerated list → flowing paragraph describing three fiscal channels
- Section 4.3 (Persistence): Two bullets → narrative paragraph with justification
- Section 5.1 (MVPF components): Four bullets → prose calculation walkthrough
- Section 7.1 (Implications): Numbered bold headers → flowing prose
- Section 7.2 (Limitations): Bold headers → flowing paragraphs
- Appendix: Variable definitions → prose format

The revised manuscript contains no bullet lists in the main text.

### 2. Literature Gaps (All Reviewers)

**Concern:** Missing key methodological citations (Goodman-Bacon, Callaway & Sant'Anna, Kleven, Pomeranz, Blattman).

**Response:** We have added all suggested citations:

- **Goodman-Bacon (2021)** and **Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021)**: Added in Introduction footnote explaining why DiD methodology concerns do not apply to our RCT-based identification
- **Kleven (2014)** and **Pomeranz (2015)**: Added in Introduction when discussing informality and fiscal constraints, explaining how tax capacity depends on third-party reporting and formal employment
- **Blattman et al. (2020)**: Added in Section 7 when comparing to other UCT evidence, noting the nine-year persistence findings from Uganda

All citations are now integrated into the text and appear in the bibliography.

### 3. Uncertainty Documentation (GPT-5-mini, Grok)

**Concern:** Bootstrap procedure description too terse; CIs appear implausibly tight; need component-level SEs and variance decomposition.

**Response:** We have added a new subsection "Inference and Uncertainty Quantification" (Section 4.6) that:

- Explains the Monte Carlo methodology (1,000 replications)
- Specifies the distributions used for each parameter (Normal for treatment effects using published SEs; Beta distributions for fiscal parameters)
- Includes Table 6 showing component-level SEs and 95% CIs
- Provides variance decomposition showing income tax externality (42%) and spillover WTP (40%) dominate MVPF uncertainty
- Explains why the direct MVPF CI is tight: WTP is mechanically fixed at the transfer amount, so uncertainty enters only through small fiscal externalities

### 4. External Validity (Gemini, Grok)

**Concern:** Need quantitative scenarios for government implementation given differences between NGO and government delivery.

**Response:** We have added a new subsection "Government Implementation Scenarios" (Section 7.3) with Table 8 showing:

- MVPF under varying administrative costs (15%, 25%, 35%, 45%)
- MVPF under varying targeting leakage (0%, 10%, 20%)
- Combined best-case, median, and worst-case government scenarios

Key finding: A poorly implemented government program could have MVPF as low as 0.49, highlighting that implementation quality is a first-order determinant of welfare efficiency.

## Additional Improvements

- Strengthened introduction hook with striking statistics on global UCT scale (1.5 billion people, $500B annual spending)
- Added revision footnote linking to parent paper
- Expanded page count from ~34 to 37 pages

## Summary

The revision transforms the manuscript from a "calibration exercise with bullets" to a rigorous AER-quality paper with flowing prose, comprehensive literature engagement, transparent uncertainty quantification, and quantitative external validity analysis. We believe these changes address the substantive concerns raised by all three reviewers.
