## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-6

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0208
**Parent Title:** Making Wages Visible: Labor Market Dynamics Under Salary Transparency (v10)
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION (2 of 3 reviewers) / MAJOR REVISION (1 of 3)
**Revision Rationale:** Structural overhaul to achieve AER-level presentation. User directive: "make the two types of datasets show as much parallelism as possible when presented. Why not start with QWI data first, before CPS. Consolidated tables, Panel A and B, with similar progressions of specifications."

## Key Changes Planned

- Reorder all sections to present QWI (administrative data) before CPS (survey data)
- Create consolidated Panel A (QWI) / Panel B (CPS) tables with parallel specification progressions
- Eliminate standalone cross-dataset comparison section (every table IS a comparison)
- Reorder figures: QWI trends before CPS trends
- Tighten prose around the new QWI-first narrative

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT (Major):** CPS permutation p=0.154 needs clearer presentation → addressed by leading with QWI (p<0.001)
2. **Grok (Minor):** Structure already strong → consolidated tables further improve coherence
3. **Gemini (Minor):** Ready for top journal → structural polish for AER submission

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: same (salary transparency effects on wages, gender gap, dynamism)
- Identification strategy: same (staggered DiD with C-S estimator)
- Primary data sources: same (CPS ASEC + Census QWI)
- All regression results: same (no new analysis)
