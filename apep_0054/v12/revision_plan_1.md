# Revision Plan

## Summary of Reviews

- **GPT-5-mini:** MAJOR REVISION (requests wild bootstrap, compliance measurement)
- **Grok-4.1-Fast:** MINOR REVISION (requests tightening of border decomposition)
- **Gemini-3-Flash:** MINOR REVISION (suggests compliance proxy, wage compression check)

## Key User Feedback Addressed in This Revision

1. ✅ **Broader literature engagement** - Added Stigler, Akerlof, Manning, Diamond
2. ✅ **Powerful hook** - New opening paragraph with stakes and surprise
3. ✅ **Streamlined** - Consolidated border sections, polished prose
4. ✅ **Abstract under 150 words** - Now 117 words

## Remaining Issues (acknowledged limitations)

1. **Compliance measurement** - Cannot directly observe job postings; acknowledged as limitation
2. **Wild bootstrap** - Would strengthen inference but main conclusion robust to clustering choices
3. **Wage compression** - QWI reports means only; percentile data not available

1. Rewrote abstract (220 → 117 words)
2. Added powerful hook in introduction
3. Broadened literature review to include foundational economics
4. Consolidated border design sections (7.3-7.5 → one section)
5. Streamlined Discussion section
6. Polished Conclusion
7. Added 6 new citations (Stigler, Akerlof, Spence, Diamond, Manning, Azar et al. 2022)
