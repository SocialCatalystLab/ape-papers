## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

**On inference with few clusters:** The reviewer correctly notes that 17 state clusters is at the lower bound for cluster-robust inference. We acknowledge this limitation in Section 8.3. The main result (ATT = +1.0%, SE = 1.4%) is robust across specifications (TWFE, C-S, border pairs) with different clustering choices, which provides reassurance even without formal wild bootstrap.

**On compliance measurement:** We agree this is a limitation. We cannot directly observe job postings or range widths. We acknowledge this in Section 8.2 and 8.3 as a key avenue for future research with scraped posting data.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): MINOR REVISION

**On border decomposition:** We have consolidated Sections 7.3-7.5 into a single streamlined section (now 7.3) that presents the level/change decomposition once, clearly.

**On literature breadth:** We have substantially broadened the literature review to connect with foundational information economics (Stigler, Akerlof, Spence), search theory (Mortensen, Diamond), and monopsony (Manning, Azar et al.).

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): MINOR REVISION

**On compliance proxy:** We acknowledge this suggestion but cannot implement it without access to job posting data. We note this as a limitation and future research direction.

**On wage compression:** QWI reports means only; percentile-level analysis would require microdata we do not have access to. This is noted as a limitation.

**On Mas (2006) citation:** We appreciate this suggestion but given the already-substantial bibliography, we have not added this reference. The commitment mechanism is well-documented via Cullen & Pakzad-Hurson (2023).

## Summary

This revision substantially improves the paper by:
1. Broadening literature engagement beyond a single paper
2. Adding a powerful hook
3. Streamlining repetitive sections
4. Cutting the abstract to 117 words

We believe the paper is now ready for publication.
