## Summary

Internal review conducted through the advisor review pipeline (Stage A). All 4 advisor models (GPT-5-mini, Grok-4.1-Fast, Gemini-3-Flash, Codex-Mini) passed the fatal error check after 4 rounds of iterative fixes addressing:

1. Placeholder text removal
2. Bacon decomposition number accuracy
3. YRBS wave timing consistency
4. First-stage limitation caveats
5. RI p-value reporting notes
6. Treatment coding rule clarification

The paper was then reviewed through the exhibit review (Stage A.5) and prose review (Stage A.6) pipelines, with all constructive feedback incorporated in the Stage C revision.

**Decision:** PASS — proceed to external review.
