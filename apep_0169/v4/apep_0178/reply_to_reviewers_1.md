## Summary

We thank all three reviewers for their constructive feedback on the original manuscript. This revision represents a major reframing of the paper, shifting from an "Atlas of Self-Employment" geographic focus to a sharper contribution about institutions and inequality. We address each reviewer's concerns below.

## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): Major Revision

### Concern 1: Causal language too strong
**Response:** We have moderated causal language throughout. The abstract and introduction now explicitly state that we estimate "conditional associations under a selection-on-observables assumption, not experimentally identified causal effects." We interpret findings as informative about the structure of earnings differences, not as treatment effects.

### Concern 2: Missing industry/occupation controls
**Response:** We acknowledge this limitation. The ACS provides limited industry detail, and adding occupation would substantially reduce sample size. We now discuss this explicitly in the Limitations section: "The ACS lacks detailed industry information to test this directly, but it remains a plausible mechanism."

### Concern 3: Geographic variation overemphasized
**Response:** We have demoted geographic variation from the paper's centerpiece to a robustness section. The title no longer references "Atlas" and the state-level results now appear as supplementary evidence rather than a core contribution.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): Minor Revision

### Concern 1: External validity to smaller states
**Response:** We now acknowledge this limitation explicitly: "our sample covers ten large states that account for 55 percent of U.S. employment but may not represent smaller states or rural labor markets."

### Concern 2: Institutions framing
**Response:** Thank you. We have strengthened this framing throughout, with a new theoretical section ("Why Might Incorporation Pay?") that develops the institutional access argument more fully.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): Minor Revision

### Concern 1: Gender finding is the key contribution
**Response:** We agree and have reframed the paper accordingly. The gender finding now appears prominently in the abstract, introduction, and concluding discussion. The title emphasizes "Gender" as a core dimension.

### Concern 2: State-level analysis less central
**Response:** We have demoted the state-level analysis as suggested, removing "Atlas" from the title and moving geographic variation to a robustness/supplementary section.

## Additional Changes

1. Added three new references to strengthen literature engagement
2. Clarified IPW vs AIPW: primary estimates use IPW, with AIPW as robustness check
3. Tightened prose throughout for clarity and flow
4. Added Acemoglu & Autor (2011) citation to connect to institutions literature

We believe these revisions address all substantive concerns while maintaining the paper's core contribution: documenting that formal business institutions deliver their benefits unequally by gender.
