# Internal Review - Round 2

## Follow-up on Round 1 Issues

### Addressed Issues
1. All numerical inconsistencies between text and tables have been resolved (institution counts, cohort counts, MW values, P75 earnings, state counts).
2. Abstract now honestly acknowledges placebo failure and region-by-cohort sensitivity.
3. Table notes clarify panel vs. analysis sample distinctions throughout.
4. Graduate degree summary statistics added to Table 1.
5. Section cross-references corrected (6.3 → 7.3).

### Remaining Concerns (Non-Fatal)
1. **TWFE without modern estimator:** Acknowledged in text. The continuous treatment variable and staggered but monotonic MW changes make this less problematic than the binary treatment DiD case, but implementing Callaway-Sant'Anna would strengthen the paper.
2. **2019 cohort MW window:** Uses 2-year window vs. 3-year for other cohorts. Paper documents this and notes robustness to dropping 2019. Acceptable with the footnote disclosure.
3. **Placebo failure:** Honestly reported and discussed. The paper appropriately frames results as "suggestive evidence" rather than causal claims.

### Assessment
The paper has substantially improved through the revision process. Internal consistency issues have been resolved. The remaining concerns are substantive methodological choices (TWFE vs. modern estimators, placebo interpretation) rather than errors.
