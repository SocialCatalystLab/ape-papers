# Reviewer Response Plan

## Summary of Feedback

### Cross-reviewer consensus:
1. **First-stage concern** (GPT primary, Gemini secondary): Village-level RDD cannot show discontinuity in road construction. Need to better frame as reduced-form/ITT, or provide descriptive evidence.
2. **Missing CIs in tables** (GPT): Add 95% CIs to main results table.
3. **Literature additions** (all): Add Field et al. (2010), Bernhardt et al. (2018), Shamdasani (2021) references.
4. **Conceptual framework** could be tighter/more connected to results.

### GPT-specific concerns (MAJOR REVISION):
- Reframe away from "sharp RDD" language since treatment is not sharp at village level
- Add village-level first-stage discussion or fuzzy RD framing
- Missing 95% CIs in main table

### Grok-specific concerns (MINOR):
- Overall very positive, wants a few additional references
- Suggests adding power calculation (already done)

### Gemini-specific concerns (MINOR):
- Suggests OMMAS data for first-stage evidence (not feasible - data not publicly available in geocoded form)
- Suggests intermediate outcomes (school enrollment) — good idea but Census data are limited

## Revision Workstreams

### 1. Methodology (addresses GPT's core concern)
- Remove "sharp" language throughout; clarify the design is a reduced-form RDD
- Add explicit paragraph clarifying the estimand is a reduced-form discontinuity, not a treatment effect of roads
- Note that this is the policy-relevant parameter (does crossing 500 lead to better outcomes?)

### 2. Tables
- Add 95% CIs to Table 2 (main results)

### 3. Literature
- Add Field et al. (2010) and Bernhardt et al. (2018) to references and discussion section

### 4. Prose (from prose review)
- Already shortened roadmap paragraph
- Already moved covariate balance figure to appendix

### 5. Exhibits (from exhibit review)
- Already moved covariate balance figure to appendix
