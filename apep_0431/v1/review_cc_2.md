# Internal Review - Round 2

**Role:** Reviewer 2 (harsh, skeptical) + Editor (constructive)
**Paper:** Roads Without Revolution: Rural Connectivity and the Gender Gap in India's Structural Transformation (revised)

---

## Changes Since Round 1

The author addressed the key concerns from Round 1:
1. Fixed the baseline statistic (now correctly reports ~11% matching Table 1)
2. Added MDE calculation (1.2 pp at 80% power, ~11% of baseline)
3. Expanded discussion of the 0.8x bandwidth result with monotone shrinkage argument
4. Shortened roadmap paragraph per prose review
5. Moved covariate balance figure to appendix per exhibit review
6. Added N values to all robustness table panels

## Remaining Issues

### Format
- 34 pages main text + appendix. Meets requirements.
- All tables have N, all figures have proper axes.

### Methodology
- RDD implementation is thorough: McCrary, covariate balance, bandwidth sensitivity, placebo cutoffs, donut hole, RI. All checks present and well-reported.
- The MDE calculation strengthens the paper's "precisely estimated null" claim.
- The discussion of the 0.8x bandwidth result (monotone shrinkage toward zero) is convincing.

### Remaining Minor Concerns
1. The continuity assumption equation (Eq. 3) could be deleted since it restates what was explained in prose — but this is a matter of taste, not substance.
2. The conceptual framework section could be shortened by ~1 paragraph.
3. The appendix duplicates some material that could be cut to tighten the paper.

### Literature
- References adequate for the contribution. The paper cites 35+ papers including key RDD methodology (CCT, Lee & Lemieux) and the relevant India infrastructure literature (Asher & Novosad, Aggarwal, Donaldson).

### Writing
- Quality is high. Introduction is engaging. The "precisely estimated null" framing is well-executed.
- The conclusion's final line is memorable and effective.

## Overall Assessment

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean identification with massive sample
- Comprehensive robustness checks
- Honest reporting of the nightlights pre-trend failure
- MDE calculation backing up the "precisely estimated null" claim
- Strong writing throughout

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- None remaining that would warrant rejection or major revision

**Verdict:** The paper is ready for external review.
