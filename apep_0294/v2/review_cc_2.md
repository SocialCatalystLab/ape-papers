# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (automated)
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Follow-Up Review

All issues from Round 1 have been addressed. Specific verifications:

1. **T1019 percentage:** Text now says "11.2% of total program payments" matching Table 3 exactly.
2. **Provider count:** Abstract uses exact figure (617,503) matching Table 1.
3. **Tenure percentage:** All instances updated to "over 38%" matching Table 5 (8.8 + 18.3 + 11.3 = 38.4%).
4. **COVID dip:** Verified from data: minimum index = 54.64, drop = 45.36% ≈ 45%. Text and figure consistent.
5. **December 2024:** New paragraph in Section 2.2 explicitly distinguishes raw coverage (84 months) from analysis sample.
6. **Table 4:** Growth rates show "N/A" instead of "---" for 2018 and 2024.
7. **Bibliography:** Borusyak et al. cited in two DiD methodology paragraphs. Zuckerman cited in payment adequacy section. Buchmueller cited for geographic variation.

No remaining issues.
