**Reviewer:** Claude Code (automated)
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Summary

This is a polish revision (v2) of apep_0294. The v1 paper passed advisor review (3/4) and underwent full external review. This revision addresses:

1. **Factual errors:** Corrected T1019 spending percentage (was "more than a third", now "more than one-fifth" = 21.7% of Medicaid-specific spending). Fixed provider count rounding (618,000 → 617,503). Updated tenure percentage (37% → 38.4%).
2. **Internal consistency:** Clarified 84-month vs 83-month analysis sample (raw data = 84 months; time-series excludes Dec 2024). Changed Table 4 growth rate placeholders from "---" to "N/A".
3. **Exhibits:** Simplified Figure 2 (stacked area) by grouping small categories into "Other". Grouped Figure 4 entry/exit bars into quarters. Cleaned Table 3 descriptions.
4. **Prose:** Varied word repetition ("extraordinarily"), tightened Section 4→5 transition, added punchy intro to NPPES section.
5. **Bibliography:** Added Borusyak et al. (2024), Zuckerman (2014), Buchmueller (2016).
6. **Appendix:** Removed redundant Figures 10 and 11 (duplicated Tables 2 and 6).

## Assessment

The revision is a straightforward polish. No new empirical analysis. All factual corrections verified against the data tables. The 84/83-month clarification is now explicit in the Coverage section.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
