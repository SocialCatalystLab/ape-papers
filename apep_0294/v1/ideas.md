## Idea 1: T-MSIS Medicaid Provider Spending — Dataset Overview Paper

**Policy:** N/A — this is a data description paper, not a policy evaluation.

**Outcome:** The T-MSIS Medicaid Provider Spending dataset (227M rows, Jan 2018–Dec 2024), released by HHS on February 9, 2026.

**Identification:** Descriptive analysis only. No causal claims. The paper characterizes the dataset's structure, coverage, and research potential through summary statistics, visualizations, and linkage architecture mapping.

**Why it's novel:** This is the first public provider-level Medicaid claims dataset. No prior academic paper has characterized its contents because the data did not exist publicly before February 2026. Over half of spending flows through Medicaid-specific procedure codes (T/H/S prefixes) invisible to Medicare researchers.

**Feasibility check:** Confirmed — data downloaded (2.9 GB Parquet), NPPES linked (99.5% match rate), all figures and tables generated from complete 227M-row dataset.
