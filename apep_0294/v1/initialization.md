## Questions Asked

This paper follows a non-standard workflow. The user provided detailed instructions directly rather than answering the standard 7-question initialization. This is a **data description paper**, not a causal inference paper.

## User Request (Verbatim)

> Write a compelling overview paper of the new T-MSIS dataset, which can serve as inspiration for the future research agenda. It should be made clear already on the first page how this new dataset opens up a new frontier for research. And then we want to understand the dataset, beautiful prose, maps, statistics, graphs, etc. Tasteful and balanced. And then datasets created for future APEP papers should be made very clear, their structure and potential use cases. Since this is not a normal APEP paper, use your own judgement. An appendix with table of contents and many details seems wise, while keeping main manuscript short.
