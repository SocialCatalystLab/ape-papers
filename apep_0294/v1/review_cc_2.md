# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (self-review)
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Changes Since Round 1

1. Removed timing_data.tex placeholder from author footnote
2. Inlined all 6 tables to eliminate external file dependencies
3. Added explicit notes reconciling provider counts (617K cumulative vs ~270K monthly peak)
4. Added explanation of $4B spending gap between Table 1 and Table 4 (December 2024 exclusion)
5. Fixed Table 6 rounding (percentages now sum to exactly 100.0%)
6. Applied prose improvements: removed roadmap paragraph, sharpened three-purposes sentence, improved final sentence, fixed passive voice

## Assessment

All issues from Round 1 and advisor review have been addressed:
- Tables are now self-contained (no external \input dependencies)
- No placeholder values in the compiled PDF
- Provider count discrepancy is explicitly documented
- December 2024 handling is clearly noted with growth rates suppressed
- Prose quality improved per Gemini review suggestions

## Verdict

**ACCEPT.** Paper is ready for external referee review.
