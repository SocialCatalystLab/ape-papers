# Reviewer Response Plan

## Grouped Concerns

### 1. Bibliography (ALL 3 reviewers)
- Currently only ~8 citations — far too few
- Missing: Medicaid supply-side literature, HCBS workforce, staggered DiD methods, data infrastructure precedents, T-MSIS data quality
- **Action:** Add 8-10 references covering Currie & Gruber, Clemens & Gottlieb 2017, Polsky 2015, Grabowski 2006, Goodman-Bacon 2021, Sun & Abraham 2021, Roth 2023, PHI workforce reports

### 2. Sections 5-6 Prose Quality (GPT, noted by Grok)
- Sections 5 (Panels) and 6 (Agenda) read too much like outlines/bullet templates
- **Action:** Rewrite into narrative paragraphs while preserving content

### 3. No Flagship Empirical Application (GPT strongly, Grok mildly)
- GPT wants at least one DiD implementation
- Grok suggests sample DiD in appendix
- Gemini accepts as data paper
- **Action:** Respectfully decline. This is explicitly a data description/infrastructure paper, not a causal inference paper. The user requested this format. Acknowledge as limitation in reply.

### 4. Validation/Benchmarking (GPT, Gemini)
- Compare T-MSIS aggregates to MACPAC/Medicaid.gov
- **Action:** Add brief validation paragraph referencing external totals

### 5. MCO Encounter Pricing (GPT, Gemini)
- "Medicaid Amount Paid" may be imputed shadow price for MCO encounters
- **Action:** Add paragraph discussing this in data limitations section

### 6. Suppression Quantification (GPT, Grok)
- Currently acknowledged but not quantified
- **Action:** Add sentence with suppression share estimate

### 7. Prose Polish
- Minor items from prose review already addressed (roadmap, three purposes, final sentence)

## Execution Order
1. Add references to references.bib
2. Rewrite Sections 5-6 into narrative prose
3. Add validation paragraph
4. Add MCO encounter discussion
5. Add suppression quantification
6. Recompile
