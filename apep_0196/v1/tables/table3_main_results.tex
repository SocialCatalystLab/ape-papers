\floatfoot{\textit{Notes:} Dependent variable is log college enrollment. CS DiD uses the Callaway-Sant'Anna (2021) estimator with never-treated states as controls. Standard errors clustered at the state level. Estimates represent effect in log points; multiply by 100 for approximate percentage effect.}
