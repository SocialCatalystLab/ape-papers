# Internal Review - Round 2

**Role:** Self-review as Editor
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Verdict: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT

## Assessment

The paper has been revised to address Round 1 comments. Key improvements:
- Minnesota's always-treated status is now explicitly discussed in the empirical strategy
- Power discussion is thorough and honest
- Table notes clearly explain N=337 and the common sample construction
- set.seed() added for bootstrap reproducibility

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. The paper could benefit from a brief sensitivity check dropping Minnesota entirely (acknowledge in text if not run).
2. Figure 2 confidence ribbons overlap somewhat — noted but acceptable for the event study visualization.

## Decision

The paper is ready for external referee review. The research question is novel, the identification is credible, and the results are reported honestly. Proceed to Stage B.
