# Internal Review - Round 1

**Role:** Self-review as Reviewer 2 (harsh) + Editor (constructive)
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Verdict: MINOR REVISION

## Major Comments

1. **Statistical significance framing.** The paper leads with the log specification result (18% reduction, p=0.02) while the level specification is insignificant (p=0.248). While the log specification is well-motivated, the paper should be more upfront about this divergence in the abstract and introduction. Currently handled well in Discussion section.

2. **Minnesota always-treated.** MN (2011) has zero pre-treatment observations in the 2015-2023 panel. The paper acknowledges this and notes MN doesn't contribute to ATT estimation. Satisfactory but could note the robustness of dropping MN entirely.

3. **Power limitations.** The MDE of ~26% in levels is large. The paper's honest discussion of this is appreciated but the reader should know earlier (perhaps in the abstract) that level estimates are imprecise.

## Minor Comments

4. Panel D in Table 2 only reports column 1 — explained in notes but visually sparse.
5. COVID-19 coinciding with the 2020-2021 adoption wave deserves slightly more attention.
6. The placebo test on T40.4 is a strength — well-motivated and executed.

## Summary

A solid applied micro paper with a novel policy question, clean identification, and honest reporting of results. The main weakness is statistical power in levels, but the log specification provides meaningful evidence. The drug-class placebo test is a genuine methodological contribution. Ready for external review after minor revisions.
