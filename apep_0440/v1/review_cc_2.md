# Internal Review - Claude Code (Round 2)

**Paper:** Unlocking Better Matches? Social Insurance Eligibility and Late-Career Underemployment
**APEP ID:** apep_0440
**Date:** 2026-02-22

## Changes Since Round 1

1. Fixed all internal consistency issues flagged in advisor reviews (6 rounds of fixes)
2. Standardized all tables to percentage-point units
3. Fixed placebo text/figure mismatch (overqualification, not part-time)
4. Added first stage results to Table 5 (now "First Stage and Extensive Margin")
5. Fixed data year references (2018-2019 and 2022, with COVID explanation)
6. Fixed clustering description consistency (age level throughout)
7. Fixed heterogeneity text to match feols Table 3 values
8. Removed "No Bachelor's" row from heterogeneity table
9. Fixed kernel description (uniform, not triangular, in baseline)

## Remaining Concerns

1. **Covariate balance at 65** remains the fundamental limitation. This is inherent to the design and transparently documented. No further fix possible without different data.

2. **Power** with discrete running variable and 3 years of data. Again, inherent limitation — documented.

3. The paper is now internally consistent: all tables match text, all figure captions match content, all robustness specifications are properly labeled.

## Assessment

The paper has reached a publishable state. Internal consistency has been thoroughly verified. The null result is honestly reported with appropriate caveats. The paper meets the 25+ page requirement (33 pages total). All tables and figures are properly formatted with consistent units.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
