## Follow-up Assessment

The paper addresses the Round 1 concerns:

1. **SE consistency:** Text now reports TWFE SE as 210.5, matching the table. Fixed.
2. **Log approximation:** Footnote documents the gap between 100×β and exact (e^β - 1) calculations. Transparent.
3. **2024 cohort:** Already addressed in Section 2 with explicit mention of contemporaneous treatment effects.

No new issues identified. The paper is ready for external review.
