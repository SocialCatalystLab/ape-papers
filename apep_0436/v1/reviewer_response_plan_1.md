# Reviewer Response Plan — Round 1

## Critical Workstreams

### 1. Reframe Main Conclusion
- Lead with cultivator proletarianization as primary finding (clean pre-trends, p=0.398)
- Downgrade non-farm result to "no evidence of structural transformation" given pre-trend failure
- Restructure abstract and intro accordingly

### 2. Prose Improvements
- Rewrite opening hook (Shleifer-style concrete observation)
- Delete roadmap paragraph
- Lead results with claims, not table references
- Tighten pre-trends discussion

### 3. Estimand Clarity
- Make "two extra years of exposure" framing explicit everywhere
- Clarify this is intensity effect, not binary treatment effect

## Major Workstreams

### 4. Exhibit Improvements
- Remove Figure 1 (bar chart of sample sizes — conveys no information)
- Move Figure 5 (RI) to appendix
- Add baseline mean to robustness table

### 5. Strengthen Within-Agriculture Story
- Add household industry and other worker shares to robustness
- Note where cultivators mechanically shift

### 6. RI Caveat
- Add explicit caveat that RI permutes uniformly rather than conditional on assignment mechanism
- Frame as conservative diagnostic, not exact test

## Minor Workstreams

### 7. Missing References
- Add de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfœuille (2020) — already cited
- Note Borusyak et al. (2021) in methodology discussion

### 8. Table 1 Improvements
- Format SDs in parentheses below means (if table code allows)
