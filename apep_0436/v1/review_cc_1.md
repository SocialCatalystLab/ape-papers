# Internal Review Round 1

**Verdict:** CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT

## Summary

This paper studies the effect of India's MGNREGA employment guarantee on structural transformation using village-level Census data from SHRUG. The main finding is that MGNREGA induced within-agriculture proletarianization (cultivator-to-laborer shift) rather than the farm-to-non-farm transition that development economists envision.

## Strengths

1. **Novel question**: First paper to study MGNREGA's effect on occupational composition rather than wages or aggregate employment
2. **Honest reporting**: Pre-trend failures for non-farm share and ag laborer share are transparently discussed
3. **Multiple estimators**: TWFE, CS-DiD, Sun-Abraham, and randomization inference provide a comprehensive picture
4. **Clean identification for cultivator share**: Pre-trend test passes (p=0.398)

## Issues Addressed in Advisor Review

1. Fixed placeholder contributor text
2. Added Sun-Abraham aggregate ATT to nightlights table
3. Fixed nightlights observation count (collapsed duplicate calibrations to unique district-year)
4. Fixed text-table inconsistencies for nightlights coefficients
5. Added observation/FE rows to robustness table
6. Added gender regression table (Appendix)
7. Added clustering justification footnote
8. Standardized Phase III district count
9. Fixed p-value formatting (<0.001 instead of 0.000)
10. Added note about CS-DiD control group structure

## Remaining Minor Issues

- Could improve opening hook (per prose review)
- Summary statistics table could use parenthetical SDs
- Figure formatting could be refined

These are addressed in the Stage C revision cycle.
