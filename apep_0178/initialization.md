## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0175
**Parent Title:** The Atlas of Self-Employment in America: Incorporation, Gender, and the Geography of Entrepreneurial Returns
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION (from referee reviews)
**Revision Rationale:** User-directed comprehensive reframing - drop grandiose "Atlas" framing, find intellectual core, sharpen prose, upgrade to doubly robust methods

## Key Changes Planned

1. **New title:** "Does Incorporation Pay? Legal Form, Gender, and the Returns to Self-Employment"
2. **New framing:** Center on institutions and inequality, not geographic mapping
3. **Rewritten introduction:** Sharp prose, clear puzzle, integrated literature
4. **Method upgrade:** Doubly robust (AIPW) as primary, IPW as robustness
5. **Demote geography:** State variation to supplementary, not central
6. **Fix references:** Resolve LaTeX citation compilation issues

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT-5 (Major Revision):** Causal language too strong, missing covariates, weak lit engagement
   → More humble about identification, better literature integration
2. **Gemini (Minor Revision):** Industry decomposition needed, tax implications
   → Add mechanism exploration section
3. **Grok (Major Revision):** Geography/gender lit gaps, industry heterogeneity
   → Better lit integration, demote geography, add mechanisms

## User-Directed Changes

- Drop "Atlas" framing entirely
- Find the big question in economics (institutions and inequality)
- Make it flow with sharp prose
- Connect to literature properly
- Fix reference question marks

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Self-employment earnings decomposition
- Identification strategy: Selection on observables (upgraded to doubly robust)
- Primary data source: ACS PUMS 2019-2022, 10 large states
