# Reviewer Response Plan — Round 1

## Summary of Reviews
- GPT-5-mini: MAJOR REVISION
- Grok-4.1-Fast: MINOR REVISION
- Gemini-3-Flash: MINOR REVISION

## Priority 1: Pre-trends sensitivity (ALL reviewers)
- Add explicit discussion that Rambachan-Roth (2023) methods apply
- Add state-specific linear trends specification as additional robustness
- Strengthen existing narrative about declining pre-trends (convergence)

## Priority 2: Heterogeneity analysis (ALL reviewers)
- Cannot add HPSA or county-level data (requires new data fetch beyond current panel)
- Will add heterogeneity by state size and by adoption cohort timing
- Note in limitations that county-level and border-county analysis is future work

## Priority 3: Formal MDE calculation (GPT)
- Add explicit power/MDE calculation based on panel characteristics
- Report consistently as ~1.5-2% throughout

## Priority 4: Discussion improvements (ALL reviewers)
- Strengthen measurement limitation discussion
- Better connect null to existing Oh & Kleiner (2025) virtual practice finding
- Note that claims data would better capture the mechanism

## Priority 5: Prose and exhibit improvements
- Implement exhibit review suggestions (already done: removed duplicates, moved table to appendix)
- Implement prose review suggestions (already done: section titles, contribution framing, conclusion)

## Priority 6: Missing references and details
- Ensure de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020) and Borusyak et al. (2024) are cited
- These are already in references.bib - verify they're cited in text
