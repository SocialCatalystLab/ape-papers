# Internal Review — Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Paper:** Parity Without Payoff (revised after Round 1)
**Date:** 2026-02-21

---

## Changes Since Round 1

1. Tables 2 and 3 now include N and BW columns (addressing advisor feedback)
2. Bandwidth sensitivity text corrected (no longer claims "none significant" when BW=800 may exclude zero)
3. RNE timing clarified (2025 edition reflects 2020 election cohort)
4. Descriptive means vs RDD estimate distinction clarified in Section 5.1
5. Figure 5 now uses robust bias-corrected CIs from rdrobust

## Assessment

All major issues from Round 1 and advisor review have been addressed. The paper is methodologically sound with:
- Complete tables (N, SE, p-values, BW for all regressions)
- Internally consistent claims
- Proper temporal ordering of treatment and outcomes

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. Opening sentence could be sharper (prose review suggestion)
2. "It is worth noting" filler phrase on page 11
3. Final conclusion sentence could be punchier

These are polish items, not substantive concerns.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
