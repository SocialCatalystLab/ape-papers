# Research Ideas

## Idea 1: Fentanyl Test Strip Legalization and Synthetic Opioid Overdose Deaths
**Policy:** State laws removing fentanyl test strips (FTS) from drug paraphernalia definitions. Staggered adoption: RI & MA (2018), NC & VA (2019), AZ/DE/MN (2021), major wave of ~11 states in 2022 (AL, CT, GA, LA, NV, NM, TN, WV, WI, OH), another ~11 in 2023 (AR, FL, HI, IL, KS, KY, MS, NH, SC, SD, UT). ~40-45 treated states by end-2023. Only 5 states never adopted (ID, IN, IA, ND, TX).
**Outcome:** Synthetic opioid (fentanyl) overdose deaths from CDC WONDER Multiple Cause of Death files (ICD-10 T40.4 for fentanyl, X40-X44/X60-X64/X85/Y10-Y14 for drug overdose). State-year level, 1999-2023. Also: all drug overdose deaths, stimulant deaths (heterogeneity).
**Identification:** Staggered DiD (Callaway-Sant'Anna 2021) exploiting 6 years of policy rollout (2018-2023). ~40 treated states, ~5 never-treated + late-adopters as controls. 8+ pre-treatment years (2010-2017). Event study plots, HonestDiD bounds, randomization inference. Controls for concurrent harm reduction laws (naloxone access, syringe services, PDMPs). Placebo test: non-drug mortality (cancers, cardiovascular).
**Why it's novel:** One existing TWFE paper in a health-services journal (Bhai, McMichael & Mitchell 2025 in MCRR). No economics paper exists. Modern CS-DiD methods correct known TWFE bias under staggered adoption. We add HonestDiD sensitivity, randomization inference, subgroup analysis by fentanyl prevalence, and welfare calculations (VSL-based).
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed — CDC WONDER publicly available with no restrictions for state-level data. 40+ treated states with clear adoption dates (LAPPA, NCSL databases). Pre-treatment data back to 1999. Strong variation for identification.

## Idea 2: The CROWN Act and Black Labor Market Outcomes
**Policy:** State CROWN (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act laws banning discrimination based on natural hairstyles. California first (2019), then NJ & NY (2019), CO/MD/VA/WA (2020), CT/DE/NE/NV/NM/OR (2021), AK/IL/LA/ME/MA/TN (2022), AR/MI/MN/TX (2023), NH/VT (2024). 27 states + DC by 2024.
**Outcome:** Black employment rates, earnings, occupational composition from ACS 1-Year PUMS (2005-2024). Key outcome: Black women's representation in "appearance-sensitive" occupations (customer-facing professional services, hospitality, finance). Secondary: Black-white employment gap, log earnings, labor force participation.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD (CS 2021) with 27 treated states over 2019-2024. 14 pre-treatment years (2005-2018). Never-treated states as comparison group (~23 states). Heterogeneity by occupation type (customer-facing vs. back-office), gender (Black women vs. Black men), industry (professional services vs. blue-collar). Event study, pre-trend validation, HonestDiD bounds.
**Why it's novel:** Zero causal studies exist — in any discipline. Only legal analyses and survey-based descriptive studies. First economics paper to estimate causal effects of anti-hair discrimination laws on labor market outcomes. Contributes to literatures on anti-discrimination enforcement (Neumark & Stock 2006), identity in the workplace (Akerlof & Kranton 2000), and intersectionality in labor economics.
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed — ACS 1-Year PUMS available via Census API (2005-2023), with state identifiers, race, occupation, earnings, employment. 27 treated states exceed the 20-state threshold. Cell sizes adequate for most states (concern for small-population states like VT, NH, AK — can be dropped or handled with multilevel models).

## Idea 3: State Surprise Medical Billing Protections and Emergency Care Utilization
**Policy:** State laws protecting patients from out-of-network "surprise" medical bills, primarily for emergency services and in-network facility referrals. New York (2015 comprehensive), California (2017 AB 72), Connecticut (2018), Colorado (2020), Texas (2020), Oregon (2020), Georgia (2021), Ohio (2021), etc. ~18-22 states adopted some form before the federal No Surprises Act (Jan 2022). Federal law provides a natural end-point for the study.
**Outcome:** Emergency department utilization (visits per capita), out-of-pocket spending, insurance premiums, in-network physician participation rates. Data: CMS Medicare claims (via Research Data Assistance Center), ACS health insurance variables, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
**Identification:** Staggered DiD exploiting state adoption before federal preemption in 2022. 18-22 treated states, ~28-32 controls. Pre-treatment from ~2010-2014 depending on state. Federal law provides a useful "donut" test: does the marginal effect of state laws disappear after federal implementation? Event study design with CS-DiD.
**Why it's novel:** Cooper et al. (2019) studied balance billing in New York only. No multi-state DiD exists. Federal preemption creates a natural experiment within an experiment. Contributes to literature on information asymmetries in healthcare markets and provider network adequacy.
**Feasibility check:** MODERATE — State adoption dates well-documented (Commonwealth Fund, NCSL). Outcome data more challenging: MEPS has small state-level samples; Medicare claims require restricted access. ACS health insurance variables are available but coarse. May need to rely on aggregate hospital utilization data from HCUP (requires DUA) or public sources.

## Idea 4: State E-Verify Mandates and Agricultural Labor Markets
**Policy:** State laws mandating use of the E-Verify employment eligibility system. Arizona (2008 all employers), Mississippi (2008), South Carolina (2009), Alabama (2011), Georgia (2011), Louisiana (2012), Tennessee (2012), North Carolina (2013), etc. ~10-15 states with broad mandates by 2015. Some states mandate only for public employers or large firms.
**Outcome:** Agricultural employment, wages, and farm output. Data: QWI by industry (NAICS 11 agriculture), USDA Census of Agriculture (every 5 years), BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). Also: broader low-skill labor market outcomes from ACS.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD on states with universal E-Verify mandates (not just public employer). About 10-15 states treated over 2008-2015. Pre-treatment from 2000-2007. CS-DiD with agricultural vs. non-agricultural outcomes (DDD). Placebo: high-skill sectors unaffected by verification requirements.
**Why it's novel:** Existing literature (Orrenius & Zavodny 2015, Amuedo-Dorantes & Bansak 2014) used older methods. No CS-DiD study exists. Agricultural sector focus (where unauthorized labor is concentrated) is underexplored. Could examine farm mechanization as a margin of adjustment.
**Feasibility check:** MODERATE — Only ~12 states with broad mandates (below 20 threshold). Could expand to include partial mandates (public employers, large firms) for ~20 states total, but this introduces measurement error. QWI agricultural data is available via Census API. USDA data is publicly available. Agricultural focus is novel but sample size concern with few treated states.

## Idea 5: State IVF Insurance Mandates and Fertility Patterns
**Policy:** State laws mandating health insurance coverage of in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies. Early adopters: Illinois (1991), Massachusetts (1987), Rhode Island (1989), Maryland (1985), Arkansas (1987). More recent: Connecticut (2005), New Jersey (2001), Delaware (2018), Colorado (2022), Maine (2022). ~20 states have some mandate; ~16 with comprehensive IVF coverage mandates.
**Outcome:** Birth rates by maternal age, multiple birth rates (twins/triplets), first birth timing. Data: CDC WONDER natality files (state-year-age level, 1995-2023), ACS fertility variables.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD with states adopting over 1985-2022. Long time horizon. CS-DiD estimator to handle heterogeneous effects across early vs. late adopters. Event study showing delayed fertility followed by catch-up. Placebo: male outcomes, naturally conceived birth patterns.
**Why it's novel:** Schmidt (2007) and Bitler & Schmidt (2006) studied early mandates with TWFE. No study uses modern CS-DiD methods or includes the post-2015 wave of new mandates (DE, CO, ME, NY expansion). Long-run fertility timing and career effects for women remain unexplored. Could examine whether mandates reduce the "motherhood penalty" by allowing delayed fertility.
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed — CDC natality data publicly available (CDC WONDER), ACS 1-Year PUMS available via Census API. ~16-20 treated states. Policy dates well-documented (NCSL, Resolve). Long pre-treatment period for early adopters may create issues; focus on post-2000 mandates for cleaner design.
