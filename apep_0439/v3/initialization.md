## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-6

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0439
**Parent Title:** Where Cultural Borders Cross: Gender Equality at the Intersection of Language and Religion in Swiss Direct Democracy
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION (publication polish)
**Revision Rationale:** Pure polish pass — prose tightening, exhibit fixes, minor consistency. No new analysis or code changes beyond table/figure formatting.

## Key Changes Planned

- Fix scientific notation in Tables 5 and 6 (permutation mean/SD, interaction coefficient)
- Fix figure caption color/content mismatches (Figures 1 and 4)
- Promote interaction plot (Figure A3) to main text Section 6.3
- Fix Table 1 "Referenda" column header truncation
- Prose polish throughout (tighten introduction, framework, results, discussion, conclusion)
- Add N=8,727 arithmetic explanation (unbalanced panel note)
- Remove redundancy across sections (modularity validation point repeated 3x)

## Inherited from Parent (v2)

- Research question: Same (intersection of language and religion on gender voting)
- Identification strategy: Same (OLS with interaction, within-canton FE, permutation inference)
- Primary data source: Same (swissdd referendum data, BFS municipality data)
- All R analysis code: Same (no re-estimation, formatting fixes only)
- All figures: Same (no regeneration needed, caption fixes only)
