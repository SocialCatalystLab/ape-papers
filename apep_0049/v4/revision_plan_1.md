1. **Fuzzy RD table**: Present first-stage/TOT results in a formal table (all 3 reviewers)
2. **Discrete running variable**: Discuss and address discreteness of Census population (GPT-5-mini)
3. **Unit consistency**: Clarify proportion vs. percentage point units (Gemini advisor, exhibit review)
4. **Repetition**: Reduce overlap between Results Section 5.8 and Discussion Section 6.1 (Grok, prose review)
5. **Prose improvements**: Strengthen opening, add vivid comparisons (prose review)
