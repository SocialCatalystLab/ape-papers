# Internal Review - Claude Code (Round 2)

**Role:** Reviewer 2 (follow-up)
**Paper:** Does Federal Transit Funding Improve Local Labor Markets?
**Round:** 2

---

## Follow-up Review

Issues from Round 1 have been addressed:
- Unit clarification added to Table 3 notes
- Near-threshold table significance stars fixed (mechanical difference now marked with dagger)
- Introduction repetition reduced (removed duplicated $5 billion fact)
- Cost-benefit section includes vivid "used car" comparison
- Results section opening strengthened

## Remaining Minor Issues
1. Consider adding Eggers et al. (2018) citation in the methodology discussion text (already in bib)
2. No other substantive issues remain

## Assessment
Paper is methodologically sound with comprehensive robustness checks. The revision successfully addresses all major concerns from v3. The addition of real FTA data, fuzzy RD, power analysis, and cost-benefit framing significantly strengthens the contribution.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
