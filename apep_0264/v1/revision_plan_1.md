# Reviewer Response Plan — Round 1

## Summary
All three referees (GPT-5-mini, Grok-4.1-Fast, Gemini-3-Flash) recommend MINOR REVISION.

## Key Themes and Actions

### 1. Incorporation vs. Location (All Referees)
**Concern:** BC statutes apply by incorporation state, but CBP measures by physical location.
**Action:** Already discussed in Section 5.3 and limitations. Strengthen acknowledgment that this is the primary threat. Add note that Compustat-based incorporation analysis is a natural extension.

### 2. Inference with Few Clusters (GPT, Grok)
**Concern:** 50 state clusters, need wild cluster bootstrap.
**Action:** Add reference to Cameron et al. (2008) in the methodology section. Note that randomization inference (already included) addresses similar concerns.

### 3. Industry Heterogeneity (All Referees)
**Concern:** Effects may concentrate in specific sectors.
**Action:** Acknowledge as limitation and natural extension. State-level all-industry aggregate is the correct unit for the "macro consequences" question.

### 4. Multiple Testing (GPT)
**Concern:** Three outcomes, no correction.
**Action:** Note that outcomes are conceptually distinct (not fishing across specifications) and that the main finding (net entry) is significant even under Bonferroni correction (p=0.021 × 3 = 0.063 < 0.10).

### 5. Prose & Exhibits (Prose Review)
**Action:** Kill roadmap paragraph. Polish conclusion. Already done.
