# Internal Review Round 1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Verdict:** MINOR REVISION

## Summary

This is a structural revision of apep_0208 (v10) that reorganizes the paper to present QWI administrative data before CPS survey data, with consolidated Panel A/B tables showing parallel specification progressions. The core results are unchanged from the parent paper.

## Strengths

1. **QWI-first structure is a major improvement.** Leading with administrative records (51 clusters, p < 0.001) before confirming with CPS microdata makes the evidence far more compelling.
2. **Consolidated tables are elegant.** Panel A (QWI) / Panel B (CPS) structure allows direct cross-dataset comparison within a single table.
3. **Prose quality is high.** The opening is now punchy (Colorado fact) and the results narrative flows naturally.
4. **Cross-dataset concordance section** in Discussion is well-argued.

## Issues

1. **Industry heterogeneity text revised but could be tighter.** The individual TWFE coefficients in Table 7 don't tell a clean story. Consider moving to appendix (exhibit review agrees).
2. **Minor CPS number discrepancies.** The C-S DDD (0.0402) vs TWFE DDD (0.0488) difference is now documented but could confuse readers. Consider using consistent estimator labels.
3. **Figure 2 seasonality.** QWI quarterly data has sawtooth patterns that make visual identification harder (exhibit review flagged this).

## Decision

MINOR REVISION — Address prose suggestions from exhibit/prose reviews, proceed to external review.
