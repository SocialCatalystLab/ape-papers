**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Date:** 2026-02-07

## Summary

After advisor review fixes (3 rounds), all major consistency issues resolved. The paper is ready for external review.

## Changes Since Round 1

1. Fixed industry heterogeneity text-table mismatch (removed fabricated pooled estimates)
2. Clarified NY treatment timing convention with explicit footnote
3. Added QWI data access date (January 2026)
4. Clarified HonestDiD median-unbiased estimate vs regression coefficient
5. Added notes explaining C-S vs TWFE DDD differences in alt_inference table
6. Improved QWI summary table note to clarify pre-treatment observation counts
7. Applied prose review suggestions: Shleifer-style opening, killed roadmap, improved concordance language

## Remaining Issues

None fatal. The paper is structurally sound with QWI-first presentation, consolidated tables, and clear documentation of all estimator differences.

## Decision

ACCEPT — Proceed to external referee review.
