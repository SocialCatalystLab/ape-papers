I have reviewed the draft paper "The Geography of Medicaid’s Invisible Workforce: A ZIP-Level Portrait of Provider Spending in New York State" for fatal errors. Below is my assessment:

### 1. DATA-DESIGN ALIGNMENT
- **No fatal errors found.** The data coverage (January 2018 – December 2024) is internally consistent with the analysis of policy shocks like COVID-19 (2020), ARPA (2021), and Medicaid Unwinding (2023). The paper correctly notes that December 2024 data is partially processed and handles it consistently by including it in totals but excluding it from the monthly time series (Figure 8).

### 2. REGRESSION SANITY
- **No fatal errors found.** While this is a descriptive paper without a formal regression table (e.g., no $\beta$ coefficients or standard errors reported), the summary statistics in Tables 1–5 are within plausible ranges for the New York Medicaid program ($144.8 billion total spending over 7 years). Ratios such as $/Claim and $/Provider do not show "Inf" or "NaN" values.

### 3. COMPLETENESS
- **FATAL ERROR 1: Missing Required Element (N counts in tables)**
  - **Location:** Table 5 (page 16).
  - **Error:** The "Mean (all counties)" row reports a mean HHI of 6,117 and a mean Spending of $1,775.9M, but it does not report the total number of counties ($N$) used to calculate these means in the table or the table notes. While the text on page 16 mentions 42 counties have T1019 activity, the table itself is incomplete without an explicit $N$ or observations count for the summary row.
  - **Fix:** Add a column for $N$ or include $N=42$ in the "Mean (all counties)" row or notes.

### 4. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
- **FATAL ERROR 2: Numbers Do Not Match**
  - **Location:** Table 4 (page 13) vs. Table 3 (page 12).
  - **Error:** Table 3 reports total spending for NYC as **$98.6 billion**. However, if you sum the spending for the five boroughs in Table 4 ($46.5 + 22.8 + 18.4 + 9.3 + 1.5$), the total is **$98.5 billion**. There is a $100 million discrepancy between the regional total and the sum of its parts.
  - **Fix:** Verify the underlying data; ensure that the sum of the five boroughs in Table 4 matches the NYC total in Table 3.

- **FATAL ERROR 3: Numbers Do Not Match**
  - **Location:** Section 3.1 (page 6) vs. Table 2 (page 7).
  - **Error:** The text in Section 3.1 states: "Only 912 billing entities generate this spending, implying an average of **$81.8 million** per entity." However, taking the spending for T1019 in Table 2 ($74,586.9 million) and dividing by the number of providers (912) yields **$81.78 million**, which rounds to **$81.8 million**. While the math is correct, the text on page 2 (Fact 1) says "$74.6 billion... generated by only 912 billing entities," which would imply an average of **$81.8 million**. However, Table 1 reports a total of 59,321 NPIs and $144.8B spending, which equals **$2.44M** per provider (matching Table 1). The inconsistency is in the *cumulative* vs *code-specific* totals. Specifically, Table 1's "Spending per provider" calculation ($144.8B / 59,321$) is $2.44M, but Table 3's NYC "Spending per provider" is $3.25M ($98.6B / 30,355). $98.6B / 30,355$ is actually **$3.248M**.
  - **Serious Internal Inconsistency:** Page 11, Section 3.3 says "NYC... accounts for 68% of statewide... spending." Table 1 shows total spending is $144.8B. 68% of $144.8B is **$98.46B**. Table 3 reports NYC spending as **$98.6B**. $98.6 / 144.8 = 68.09\%$. While close, these rounding errors/discrepancies across tables suggest the summary tables were generated from slightly different data cuts.
  - **Fix:** Ensure all regional sums and percentages match the totals reported in Table 1 exactly.

**ADVISOR VERDICT: FAIL**
