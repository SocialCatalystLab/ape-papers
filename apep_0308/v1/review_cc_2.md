**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Changes Since Round 1

1. **December 2024 consistency:** Now explicitly documented in Section 2.1 — December included in cumulative totals but excluded from time series. All notes updated consistently.
2. **Table 5 county count:** Note clarifies 42 of 62 counties have T1019 billing.
3. **Table 3 truncation:** Fixed with \small and shortened column headers.
4. **Table 4 siunitx:** Provider and organization counts wrapped in braces.
5. **Table 3 note:** Med. Mo. and % Trans. now explicitly defined.

## Remaining Issues (Non-Fatal)

1. **Table 4 rounding:** Borough spending sums to $98.5B vs Table 3's $98.6B for NYC — pure rounding, not an error.
2. **Table 2 units:** Spending shown in $M (74,586.9) while Table 1 uses $B (144.8). Internally consistent within each table but could confuse quick readers.
3. **Appendix depth:** Text-only appendix sections (A.1-A.4) could benefit from formal tables/figures, but this is enhancement, not error.

## Assessment

All fatal errors from Round 1 have been addressed. The paper is ready for external review.
